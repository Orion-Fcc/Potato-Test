# ============================================
# Potato Test app image
# ============================================
# Stage 1 builds the Vite frontend; stage 2 is the runtime — it FROM's the base
# image (which already has every Python dep + Chromium) and only layers app code
# and the built frontend on top. Installs NOTHING, so builds are fast.
#
# Build args:
#   BASE_IMAGE : base with all deps + Chromium (build it first from Dockerfile.base)
#   NODE_IMAGE : node image for the web build
#   APP_VERSION: release tag, surfaced later if needed
# ============================================
