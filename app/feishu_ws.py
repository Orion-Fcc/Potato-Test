"""Feishu long-connection (WebSocket) worker — no public callback URL needed.

The app dials OUT to Feishu over a persistent WebSocket; Feishu pushes events
down it. Authentication is by app_id/app_secret, so there is no verification
token or callback URL to expose — the right fit for an intranet deployment.

Run as its own process:  python -m app.feishu_ws

It reuses the exact same handler as the HTTP webhook (app.feishu.handle_message_event);
only the transport differs. Config is read from the System-settings store (env
fallback), and the worker waits until the bot is configured before connecting.
