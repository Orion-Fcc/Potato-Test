"""Runnable check: the agent always has the real credentials, and a stale session expires.

VRS run 42 lost 30 cases to one dead session. The bundle cached on the account was a day
old, so restoring it dropped every case on the login page — and because a bundle existed,
the executor withheld the username and password. The agent then either gave up
(「无法完成任务，因为缺少登录凭据」) or invented one (it tried `password123`), and the
repeated attempts tripped the app's 「请求过于频繁」 rate limit for the whole run.
