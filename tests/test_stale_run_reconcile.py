"""Runnable check: a run whose workers died still finishes.

Run 44 was cancelled with six cases stuck at 'running' and no finished_at, and stayed that
way for three days — a deploy recreated the celery worker mid-run, its case tasks were
already acked so nothing redelivered them, and the chord that finalizes a run only fires
once every case task returns. Nothing could ever have moved that run.
