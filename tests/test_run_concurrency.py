"""Runnable check: a run never opens more browsers than its concurrency setting.

fan_out_run hands every case to Celery at once, so the only cap was the worker's
--concurrency (16 on the test host) and the project's 并发数 did nothing. Run 44 started
16 browsers in the same instant; 7 of them hit the login page together and the burst
tripped the app under test's rate limiter.
