"""Runnable check: a captured login is re-used only while the app-side session lives.

Run 44's remaining login failures came from modelling the session wrong. The bundle was
trusted for 8 hours while the app under test forgets a session in about 30 minutes, so
cases restored a corpse and landed on the login page — and because the rate limit there is
per account, the resulting burst of logins locked the account out for the rest of the run.
