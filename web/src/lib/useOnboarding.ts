/** Decides whether the guided first-run flow opens, and remembers that it's been seen.
 *
 *  With auth on, the flag lives on the user row (`onboarded_at`), so it follows them
 *  across devices and a colleague's dismissal doesn't hide it from you. With auth off
 *  (local/dev instances have no user at all) it falls back to localStorage — otherwise
 *  the flow would be impossible to reach there.
 *
 *  Dismiss and finish are the same thing on purpose: once you've seen it, we stop
 *  opening it by itself. There is deliberately NO sidebar entry to reopen it —
 *  an operator who has finished setup never wants to see the flow again; the
 *  setup checklist on Overview stays as the way back to the individual steps. */
