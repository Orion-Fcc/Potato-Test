"""Runnable check: a case's start_url is resolved against the environment.

Cases are written once and run against dev/test/prod, so their start_url is a path like
/visitor/master/park. It used to reach the browser bare: Chromium read it as
http://localhost/visitor/master/park, got ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED, and the agent went
looking for the app on a search engine (VRS run 39, five cases wasted).
