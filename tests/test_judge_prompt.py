"""Runnable check: the judge is given a criterion and real evidence.

VRS run 37 actually created the record — the final screenshot showed
「单号 VRSSZ01-260827-0003 已通过」 — and the judge still failed it:
「缺少明确的预期结果且仅有代理自述成功，未提供足够证据」. Both halves of that reason
were the wiring's fault, not the run's: `expected` was empty (so there was no criterion
to match) and the judge only ever received action NAMES ("click", "input"), never the
browser's read-backs. Any case without an expected outcome was therefore unpassable.
