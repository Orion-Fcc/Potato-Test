    # on screen and the judge could not see it, so it kept asking for "browser evidence".

    "own state, not a claim. It is the strongest evidence you have: read it. If it shows the "
    "expected outcome (the new row in the list, the success dialog, the error message, the "
    "disabled field), that settles it and you should pass. Judge on the evidence you were "
    "given; do not fail a run for lacking a particular form of proof it was never asked to "
    "produce. Note that the screenshot is the LAST frame only — an outcome that appeared "
    "earlier and was then dismissed will not be in it, so weigh STEP_RESULTS for those."
